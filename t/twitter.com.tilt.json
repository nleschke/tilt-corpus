This includes inferences like what topics people may be interested in, how old a person is, what languages a person speaks, and whether the content of one account may be of interest to others on the platform. This helps Twitter offer better services and personalize the content Twitter shows, including ads. Without these inferences, people would have a harder time finding content that interested them, Twitter would have a more difficult time keeping the platform safe and enjoyable for everyone, and Twitter’s advertising would be less compelling to those who saw it and less valuable to Twitter’s business customers.",
